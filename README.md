#  🚗 Nagel-Schreckenberg Traffic Flow Simulation 🛣️
This Python script implements the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) model, a simple cellular automaton model used to simulate traffic flow on a one-dimensional road. The NS model helps analyze the behavior of vehicles in traffic jams and the emergence of traffic waves.

## Features ✨

-   Simulates traffic flow on a one-dimensional road using the NS model.
-   Includes parameters such as maximum velocity, randomization probability, and traffic density, Set these as per you requirements.
-   Visualizes traffic flow and analyzes traffic patterns over time.

## Requirements 🛠️

-   Python 3.x
## Dependencies 📦

The following Python libraries are required to run the script:

-   `turtle`: Used for visualizing traffic flow.
-   `numpy`: Provides support for numerical operations.
-   `matplotlib`: Optional; if you want to generate more advanced visualizations.

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
## Usage 🚀

1.  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2.  Run the script using the following command:
```bash
python3 NS_model.py
```

## Parameters 🚥

-   **Maximum Velocity:** Maximum speed at which vehicles can travel.
-   **Randomization Probability:** Probability of random deceleration.
-   **Traffic Density:** Number of vehicles on the road.

## Results 📊

-   The simulation generates visualizations depicting traffic flow patterns, congestion, and the propagation of traffic waves.
